# Python-mini-projects
Beginner-friendly Python mini projects.

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly **Python mini projects** built to practice core programming concepts such as **logic building**, **conditionals**, **loops**, and **user input**.  
All projects are written in **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** format for easy understanding and execution.
